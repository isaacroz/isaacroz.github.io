                <h1>about me.</h1>
                <p>
                    during my diploma of civil engineering, i discovered my passion for computer science
                    since i would enjoy and excel at things related to software and programming. 
                    after the completiong of my diploma, i decided to pursue a degree in software engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    although i'm still a student, i've gathered a lot of skills and experiences.
                    i have familiarised myself with software like VS Code, Blender, Figma, WPS Office, 
                    and i have a fair amount of kowledge in programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++ and Java.

                <h2>about me. again. lol.</h2>
                <p>i love music, art and entertainment. 
                    i played piano my whole life, 
                    since i taught myself to play piano on my tablet 
                    when i was around 7,
                    but never got good at it, just enough to write songs.
                    if the opportunity arises, i would love to pursue music 
                    as a part of my career.
